# Semester 4 Duo-App Project #1  
# Duo Case 23: Waste Management

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to encourage and promote better waste management practices, 
specifically targeting families who want to be more mindful of how they handle waste. 

Our app provides a way to help users reduce waste, track their environmental impact, and engage in educational quizzes about waste management.


## Project Features
1. **Weekly Challenges**  
   Users can participate in weekly tasks aimed at improving waste reduction and environmental consciousness.
   
2. **Carbon Footprint Savings**  
   Track how much waste is being reduced and calculate carbon footprint savings based on user actions.
   
3. **Mini Quizzes about Waste Management**  
   Educational quizzes provide knowledge on proper waste management techniques and best practices.
   
4. **Global Quiz-Score Leaderboard**  
   Users can compete globally to see who scores the highest on quizzes and rank on a leaderboard.


## Tech Stack

### Front-end: Jetpack Compose 
The decision was behind the fact that Google (the company behind the creation of the technology)
wants developers to use it for development instead of XML.

### Back-end: Kotlin
Kotlin was picked for development because we would like to learn more about Android development
as developers.

Android was chosen over iOS because of its open-source nature, flexibility, and broader job opportunities. 
Developing for Android is also more cost-effective since it doesn't require specific hardware like iOS development.


### Database: **Firebase**
- Firebase is used to manage real-time data storage and synchronization. 
  It provides various features, making it an ideal backend solution for our app.

  - **NoSQL Database**: Quick setup and flexible data structure with Firestore.
  - **Seamless Integration**: Easy to integrate with Android apps using Firebase SDK.
  - **Free Hosting**: Firebase offers a free tier, suitable for small-to-medium projects.
  - **Real-Time Data**: Firebase supports real-time synchronization, which is used for the leaderboard and other features in the app.
